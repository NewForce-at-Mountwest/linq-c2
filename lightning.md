1. Create a new console application
2. Create two additional files: `Cohort.cs` and `Student.cs`
3. Create a class called `Student` in `Student.cs`. Students should have a first name and a last name, both public.
4. Create a class called `Cohort` in `Cohort.cs`. Cohorts should have a name and a public name and a public list of students in that cohort.

1. Copy and paste the following list of grades into `Program.cs`.
 List<int> studentGrades = new List<int>(){ 57, 99, 87, 83, 85, 90, 86, 78, 79, 61, 93, 88, 82, 78};
- What was the average grade in this class?
- What was the highest grade?
- What was the lowest grade?
- To pass the class, you have to make above a 65. Use linq to figure out how many students passed.
